;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The `standard-themes' are a collection of light and dark themes for
;; GNU Emacs.  The `standard-light' and `standard-dark' emulate the
;; out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which technically do NOT constitute
;; a theme) while bringing to them thematic consistency,
;; customizability, and extensibility.  Other themes are stylistic
;; variations of those.
;;
;; Why call them "standard"?  Obviously because: Standard Themes Are
;; Not Derivatives but the Affectionately Reimagined Default ... themes.
